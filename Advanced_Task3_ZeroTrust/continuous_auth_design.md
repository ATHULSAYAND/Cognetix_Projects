# Continuous Authentication & Session Management

- Short-lived tokens (access < 1 hour), refresh tokens bound to device & user.
- Step-up authentication (MFA) for high-risk actions.
- Real-time posture checks from EDR/MDM included as claims.
- Revoke sessions on high-risk signals (new geolocation + privilege request).
